# Real-Time Port Scanner (Django + WebSockets + Nmap)

## Overview

This project is a **real-time network port scanner** built using **Django**, **Django Channels (WebSockets)**, and **Nmap**(nmap for accuracy). It allows users to scan single or multiple ports on any publicly accessible host and view results instantly in the browser — no page reloads required.

Traditional scanners run in the terminal, but this one provides a **web-based UI** with live streaming results, service detection, and timing metrics.

---

## 🚀 Features

-  Real-time port scanning output
-  Single port scan (fast and accurate)
-  Full port range scan (`-p-`)
-  Service & version detection (`-sV`)
-  Loader animation during scanning
-  Live scan timer
-  Asynchronous WebSocket-based updates
-  Clean and responsive UI

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|------|------------|
| Backend | Django, Django Channels, Python |
| Networking Engine | Nmap + python-nmap |
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| Real-time communication | WebSockets |
| Concurrency | ThreadPoolExecutor |

---

## How It Works

1. User inputs a target host (e.g., `scanme.nmap.org`)
2. The frontend opens a WebSocket connection
3. The backend executes an Nmap scan asynchronously
4. Each discovered port is streamed live
5. The UI updates instantly with:
   - Port status (open/closed)
   - Service & version info
   - Timer until completion

> It's like running **Nmap in the browser**, visually and interactively.

## Demo Output (Example)

```
⏱ Time: 11.7s
[OPEN] Port 22
Service: OpenSSH 8.9p1

[OPEN] Port 80
Service: Apache 2.4.58
```

## Installation & Setup

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Django
- Django Channels
- Nmap installed on system

### Install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt install nmap
pip install django channels python-nmap
```

or you can either use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Run the project

```bash
python3 -m daphne -p 8000 port_scan.asgi:application
```

Open in your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

## Future Enhancements

- Export scan results (CSV)
- Graphical progress bar
- OS fingerprinting (`-O`) — requires sudo
- Save scan history

## Why This Project Is Valuable

This project demonstrates:

- Real-time async programming
- WebSockets integration
- Nmap automation
- Network security fundamentals
- Clean full-stack design

Perfect for **resume**, **portfolio**, and **security-related interviews**.
